How to trigger event:

Click anywhere on the screen thats not an obstacle, blacksmith, or tree.

What should happen:

-A Pikachu should spawn (cool huh?)

-Pikachu's powerful aura scorches the ground he is near in any direction (2 tile radius)

-If a poor team rocket member happens to be in the affected vicinity they will be electrocuted as well! >:)



What the affected entities should do:

-The electrocuted team rocket members will then seek water to cool and clean their burns, causing the water to become dirty and change color.

-After they clean themselves they will revert back and continue to hunt down and capture pichus


What the new entity is and behavior:

-The new entity is Pikachu, the iconic pokemon hero that always thwarts team rocket!!!

-Pikachu will relentlessly hunt down any nearby team rocket member and use Thunderbolt to electrocute them once they are within range
